When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This allows other people to make suggestions and change your work when you are working with a team or want to share what you have done.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is because other people might be making changes to your repository and it would be harder to see those changes if you were unaware they were happening.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are for copying and giving credit to other's work. Clones are for copying files onto your computer so that you can edit them. Branches are for keeping a file, but having a seperate file that is changed in certain ways.
